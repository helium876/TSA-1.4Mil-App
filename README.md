A completely free opensource alternative to the overpriced app  made by IBM that was featured on [GEEK.com](http://www.geek.com/apps/tsa-paid-1-4-million-for-randomizer-app-that-chooses-left-or-right-1651337/)! 
Oh...No government backdoors here :)


```javascript
//The 1.4 million dollar line of code that makes it all happen 
$scope.MakeMoneyWithOneLineOfCode = Math.random();
```
